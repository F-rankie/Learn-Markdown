Learn-Markdown
==============

A few notes and experiments to become familiar with the Markdown syntax.
Based on the video lecture "Basic Markdown" (coursera, Data Scientist's Toolbox).

If you need to do a 'hard' new paragraph, add one free line in your .MD file.


# A primary heading (Level 1)
## A secondary heading (Level 2)
### A tertiary heading (Level 3)

For comparison, this is normal text. 
And now for lists:
* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

And back to normal text (in the .MD file, this requires a free line after the list).
